 ❌
✅
🔹 Simple Redirections
echo Hello > file.txt
→ Write "Hello" into file.txt.✅
echo World >> file.txt
→ Append "World" to file.txt.✅
cat < file.txt
→ Use file.txt as standard input for cat.✅
grep pattern < file.txt > result.txt
→ Search in file.txt and save output to result.txt.✅
sort < input.txt > sorted.txt
→ Sort contents of input.txt into sorted.txt.✅
🔹 Pipes
ls | cat -e
→ List files and show end-of-line markers.✅
cat file.txt | grep hello
→ Filter lines containing "hello".✅
cat file.txt | sort | uniq
→ Sort and remove duplicates.✅
ls | wc -l
→ Count the number of files in the current directory.✅
echo "one two three" | wc
→ Count lines, words, and characters.✅
🔹 Combining Pipes & Redirection
cat < file.txt | grep hello > output.txt✅
→ Filter lines and write to output.txt.
sort < file.txt | uniq > output.txt✅
→ Sort and remove duplicates, save to file.
cat file.txt file2.txt | grep hello > file3_out.txt✅
→ Merge two files and filter lines.
ls | grep .c > c_files.txt✅
→ List .c files into c_files.txt.
cat < input.txt | wc > count.txt✅
→ Count contents of input.txt and save.
cat file2.txt file3.txt | tee file.txt | grep hello > file4.txt✅
combine file 2 and file3 and write it to file via tee,
and get hello from the file and write it to file4
IMPORTANT:
<< eof
cat << eof
<< eof | wc -l
cat << eof | wc -l
ls | << eof
ls | cat << eof
cat < file.txt | grep hello > file2.txt | wc -l >> file3.txt❌ not needed, it is zsh related, different from bash

echo Hello > out.txt | cat < in.txt❌ not needed, it is zsh related, different from bash
